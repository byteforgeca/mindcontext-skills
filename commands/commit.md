# Smart Commit

Intelligently analyze and commit changes across your repository structure.

This will:
1. Detect changes in submodules, worktrees, PRDs, context files, and management docs
2. Categorize changes by type
3. Create appropriate commit messages following project conventions
4. Commit in the correct order (submodules first, then parent)
5. Push changes

Invoke the smart-commit skill: "smart commit"
